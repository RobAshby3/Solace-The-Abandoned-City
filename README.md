# Solace-The-Abandoned-City
Solace: The Abandoned City is a short narrative experience put together by me, Robert Ashby, and my friend, Keisuke Sano.

# Synopsis:
You are on your way to deliver a message to somebody, when you end up getting invested in their struggles of social isolation. 

# How to play?:
Download and unzip the game(located under releases), and run the unity executable. You will recieve a Windows antivirus warning, hit run anyways and it should start!

If you do run into any bugs, we would love a report.
Please do send any feedback our way at robert.n.ashby@gmail.com!
